HTML/CSS final assignment
Task is to implement responsive web page (mobile and desktop). 
The page should have at least images, menu, text content, links, table and forms. 

UI design in Figma and documentation: 
•	Make a UI mockup of your web design for both mobile and desktop in Figma
•	
•	Document following:
o	Threshold resolution for responsiveness:
	The threshold for responsive for I kept was max-width: 500px, as most mobile phone have screen width of less than 480,so as soon as the threshold reaches the max-width of 500px, the responsiveness happens and the content of page adjusts according to the screen width, and this is also responsive for both Mobile and Desktop.
•	Colors for the page. Use color wheel for planning.
	The colors that I chose from the color-wheel and used mainly on my webpage were: #ffa754, #f44336, #edafbc. I chose those colors because they have a warm feeling which I thought would be good for my restaurant webpage and matched with my webpage header background.
•	Typography: what fonts, font colors and main font sizes you will use:
o	  Font I will use for the webpage was Playfair Display, and it belonged to Serif font family, as it looked nice and professional too. Font colors I used was also like earlier ones: #ffa754, #f44336, #edafbc. Main font-sizes I used was: 13px for Navigation bar, header: 62px, paragraph: 14px, and will use according to the font-size requirement of the element.
•	Add images of the UI mockups in the document and link to Figma design:
o	DESKTOP & MOBILE: HOME, MENU, AND CONTACT US IMAGES ON NEXT PAGE.
